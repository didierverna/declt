;;; Commentary:

;; The finalization step is in charge of completing all the definitions that
;; have been created and collected by the initial introspection process.
;; Finalization occurs in two phases.
;; 1. Phase one is called "stabilization". The purpose of stabilization is
;;    primarily to compute cross-references between definitions. During
;;    stabilization, new foreign definitions may be created. When this
;;    happens, the previously computed cross-references may turn out to become
;;    incomplete. Because of that, stabilization is run over and over again
;;    until no new definition is created.
;; 2. Phase two is called "freezing". The purpose of freezing is to finish
;;    updating the definitions, with information that cannot be computed
;;    unless we know for sure that no new definition will ever be created.

;; #### WARNING: as a general rule of thumb, never assume anything about the
;; finalization state of the other definitions you access when finalizing a
;; definition (in particular, when stabilizing it). There are many small
;; methods here and there that are executed and it's too error-prone to even
;; try to rely on their execution order (scattered behavior, that's the
;; drawback of OO). For example, this is guaranteed to work all the time:
;; (symbol-package (definition-symbol definition) whereas this might fail if
;; the definition has not been stabilized yet: (definition-package
;; (home-package definition)).
