;; #### NOTE: we more or less need to follow the ASDF hierarchy, which is not
;; always correct. For example, the COMPONENT class has a PARENT slot, so we
;; do the same here. It's technically wrong, however, because systems are
;; components, but they never have a parent (the slot is always NIL). Maybe
;; ASDF does this for simplicity. It surely makes our life simpler as well,
;; especially since we have a peculiar order for calling the DOCUMENT methods,
;; not following the hierarchy (SYSTEM -> COMPONENT -> MODULE). It would be
;; more difficult to advertise the PARENT slot at the right place if it didn't
;; belong here.

;; System files
;; ------------

;; #### WARNING: gross hack going on below. ASDF system files are technically
;; Lisp files because what they contain is Lisp, but they are not ASDF
;; components. We still want to document them as other Lisp files, without
;; replicating too much of the infrastructure. The solution below consists in
;; using a fake subclass of ASDF's CL-SOURCE-FILE, called CL-SOURCE-FILE.ASD.
;; Each system file has an instance of this class stored as its
;; pseudo-component object. This instance is not completely filled in, as the
;; real ones; only what's necessary is there. Namely, this includes:
;; - the component's name (file basename) for the NAME protocol,
;; - the component's absolute pathname, for the COMPONENT-PATHNAME function,
;; - the component's parent (system), for the SOURCE-PATHNAME protocol which
;;   needs to climb up the parents in order to find the system source file.
;;   Note that a system file may contain several system definitions, but it
;;   doesn't matter; we use any of these as the parent since the point is only
;;   to get to the system file.
;; Of course, we don't mess up the original ASDF system object by telling it
;; that it has a new unwanted child (it would go to a foster home directly).
