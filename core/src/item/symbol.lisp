;; Categories

;; #### NOTE: when constructing the context lists of external and internal
;; definitions, only the definitions listed in *CATEGORIES* appear. This is
;; because these lists follow the structure of the Definitions chapter in the
;; generated manual. For instance, methods are listed under the corresponding
;; generic function, so they don't represent a category of its own.

;; #### NOTE: the order in *CATEGORIES* is important (see
;; ADD-CATEGORIES-NODE). It conditions the order of appearance of the
;; definitions in the generated manual.

;; #### NOTE: writer structures (either regular or generic) don't store the
;; complete function name (setf <name>) but only the original symbol. This, in
;; conjunction with the fact that definitions are sorted by symbol-name,
;; ensures that standalone writers (not associated with readers) are listed in
;; proper lexicographic order regardless of the SETF part of their name
;; (although that part still appears in the documentation).
